*I know what Burt is going through.  
It's the lonelinest feeling in the world.  
It's like walking down on empty street listening to your own footsteps.  
But all you have to do is to knock on every door and say:  
I'll live the way you want me to live and I'll think the way you want me to think and all the blinds will go up and all the door are open and you'll never be lonely ever again. It's up to you okay.*
